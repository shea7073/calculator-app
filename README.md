# calulator-app
simple python calculator

This was written over the course of an afternoon. This is my first program using pyqt. There definitely needs to be some refactoring and it could be nicer looking, but it does work. Numbers can only be entered using clicks of buttons in this version. An option to type the numbers in should be added eventually along with some styling.
